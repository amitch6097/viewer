    First time here and will be back!

Loved the fries!  Thinly sliced fries with Parmesan and truffle oil plus some spicy ones.  Don't recall what the spicy ones were as I am not a fan of spice.  Everybody else loved those too.  

I got three sliders - chicken (good), fried fish (good) and blt with cucumber (awesome).  

We got there for an early lunch so we had our choice of seats but this place got BUSY by the time we left.  My advice would be to go there for an early lunch.
